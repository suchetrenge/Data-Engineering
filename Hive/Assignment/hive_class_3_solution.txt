1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

load data :
-------------
load data inpath '/user/cloudera/temp_data/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

create Internal table with ORC:
---------------------------------
create table sales_order_orc
(

PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,

STORED AS ORC;

Insert data from sales_order_csv to sales_order_orc:
--------------------------------------------------------
insert into sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv;


Solution:
=========
a. Calculatye total sales per year
Ans: select year_id,sum(sales) as sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
Ans:  select productcode, sum(quantityordered) as total_order from sales_order_orc group by productcode order by total_order desc limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
Ans: select qtr_id,sum(sales) as sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
Ans: select qtr_id,sum(sales) as sales from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id order by sales limit 1;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
Ans: select country, sum(sales) as max_sales from sales_order_orc group by country order by max_sales desc limit 1;
	 select country, sum(sales) as min_sales from sales_order_orc group by country order by min_sales limit 1;
	 
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
Ans: select city,qtr_id, sum(sales) as Quaterly_sales from sales_order_orc group by city,qtr_id;

h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
Ans: with T as (select year_id,month_id,sum(quantityordered) as total_order, dense_rank() over (partition by year_id order by sum(quantityordered) desc) as denserank from sales_order_orc group by year_id,month_id) select year_id,month_id,total_order from T where denserank=1;
